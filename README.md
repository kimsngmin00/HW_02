# HW_02: Amy's Visualizing Datasets

## Graph 1: Mean scale ELA Test Scores of Grade 3 Students in NYC
![line graph ELA](https://github.com/kimsngmin00/HW_02/blob/main/NYC%20grade%203%20ELA%20test%20mean.jpg?raw=true)

In this graph, I used a citywide data of New York City from [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/) to visualize the mean English Language Arts(ELA) test scores of grade 3 students in each year. This graph thus visualizes the changes in mean ELA test scores of 3rd grade students over time, from 2006 to 2011. 

Data reference for graph 1 can be found [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2006-2011-english-language-arts-ela-test-results-by-grade-citywide-all-students).

## Graph 2: Mean scale NYS Math Test Scores of Grade 11 Students by Ethnicity
![bar graph NYS math](https://github.com/kimsngmin00/HW_02/blob/main/NYC%20math%20scores%20by%20ethnicityjpg.png?raw=true)

In this graph, I also used a citywide data of New York city from [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/). It visualizes the mean scale New York State(NYS) Mathematics Tests scores of students in grade 8 by ethnicities - Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Although there are no drastic differences in scores between each race, we can observe and compare the mean NYS math test results between each ethnic groups. 

Data reference for graph 2 can be found [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2006-2011-nys-math-test-results-by-grade-boro-by-gender).
